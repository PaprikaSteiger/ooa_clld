<h2>Welcome to WALS Online</h2>

<p class="lead">
    The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a large database of structural
    (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive
    materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of
    <a href="${request.route_url('contributors')}">${stats['contributor']} authors</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The first version of WALS was published as a book with CD-ROM in 2005 by
    ${h.external_link('http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199255917.do', label='Oxford University Press')}.
    The first online version was published in April 2008.
</p>
<p>
  The 2013 edition of WALS corrects a number of coding errors especially in Chapters 1 and 3.
  A full list of changes is available
    ${h.external_link('https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals/compare/v2011...v2013', label="here")}.
</p>
<p>
    Starting with the 2013 edition of WALS, we will release and publish sets of
    corrections periodically. Thus, any citation of WALS Online 2013 should include
    the particular version, as listed on
    ${h.external_link('https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3606197', label='Zenodo')}.
</p>
<p>
    WALS Online is a publication of the
    ${h.external_link('https://shh.mpg.de', label='Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History')}.
    It is a separate publication, edited by
    Dryer, Matthew S. & Haspelmath, Martin (Jena: Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, 2013).
    The main programmer is Robert Forkel.
